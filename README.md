I'm @fabarqz. I have a background in electronics engineering further specializing on networking and telecommunications where my current career trajectory is directed at. 

Started seriously learning programming last 2023 as a way to mitigate burnout from work. Progress has been slow as I don't have a definite study plan and has been hopping from one thing to another.
Currently trying to focus myself with python.
